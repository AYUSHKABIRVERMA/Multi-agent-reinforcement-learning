# Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning

WORK IN PROGRESS

## What's Inside
### - MADDPG
- Implementation of algorithm presented in OpenAI's publication "Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments" (Lowe et al., https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02275.pdf)
- multiagent-particle-environment: follow install instructions in https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs
- Runs, but trying to find out why it isn't learning
- Check `MADDPG/README.md` for documentation which will be done once it learns successfully 
## Running the code & Dependencies
- Python 3.6
- PyTorch 0.4.1
- multiagent-particle-environment: follow install instructions in https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs
